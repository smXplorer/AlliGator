.. _alligator-analysis-menu:

Analysis Menu
-------------

.. image:: images/AlliGator-Analysis-Menu.png
   :align: center
  
+ ``FLI Dataset``

  * ``Current ROI Analysis``: performs an analysis of the pixels located within 
    the selected ROI or, if the ``Use ROI as Search Area`` button is pressed, in 
    the optimal ROI within that region  (:kbd:`Ctrl+A`).

  * ``Multiple ROIs Analysis``

    - ``All ROIs IRF Extraction``

      + ``Interactive (Slow)``: performs the same analysis as ``Current ROI 
        Analysis`` on all ROIs currently defined, in the order they appear in the 
        **ROI Manager**. In particular, it will plot the corresponding decay, add 
        a data point to a new phasor plot in the *Phasor Graph* and display the 
        current location of the ROI. This can take quite a long time in the case 
        of a very long list of ROIs or for large datasets.
      + ``Non-interactive (Fast)``: performs the same analysis as ``Current ROI 
        Analysis`` on all ROIs currently defined, in the order they appear in the 
        **ROI Manager**. No decay is plotted, the phasor plot resulting from the 
        analysis in only displayed at the end, and no ROI is displayed on the *
        Source Image* during the analysis. This mode is recommended, as it is 
        much faster than the previous one (> x10).

      + ``Interactive (Slow)``

      + ``Non-Interactive (Fast)``

    decays within the data set and builds an histogram of the minimum and 
    maximum intensity in  each decay. This analysis is discussed in more 
    details in the :ref:`Fluorescence Decay Statistics 
    <alligator-fluorescence-decay-statistics-panel>` page of the manual

    - ``Current ROI``: the same ROI is used for all datasets in the series
    - ``All ROIs``: not supported
    - ``Sequential ROIs``: the ROIs in the ROI Manager list are used 
      sequentially for each dataset in the series (i.e. the first ROI is usd

  * ``Series NLSF Analysis``

    - ``Current ROI``: the same ROI is used for all datasets in the series
    - ``All ROIs``: not supported
    - ``Sequential ROIs``: the ROIs in the ROI Manager list are used sequentially 
      for each dataset in the series (i.e. the first ROI is used 
      for the first dataset, the second ROI for the second dataset, etc.).

  * ``Series Sum or Average``

    - ``Sum All FLI Datasets in Series``: the same ROI is used for all 
      datasets in the series
    - ``Show FLI Dataset Series Sum``: displays the sum of all datasets in the

    Corrections Definition <intensity-corrections-definition>` manual page
  * ``Playback``: successively loads every dataset in the loaded series, 
    stopping when the end of the series is reached

    + ``Use Single Phasor Calibration``: performs the same action as selecting 
      ``Single Phasor`` in the *Calibration Type* pull-down list in the **Phasor 
      Graph** panel. Both are linked (the pull-down list is updated when the menu 
      item is selected and vice versa).

      phasor to a XML file.

    + ``Use Phasor Calibration Series``: performs the same action as selecting 
      ``Phasor Series`` in the *Calibration Type* pull-down list in the **Phasor 
      Graph** panel. Both are linked (the pull-down list is updated when the menu 
      item is selected and vice versa).

      phasor curve to a XML file.
    + ``Load Phasor Calibration Series``:  loads a previously saved calibration 
      phasor curve,
