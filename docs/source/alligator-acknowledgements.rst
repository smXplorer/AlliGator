This software was developed in LabVIEW and Python as part of research performed 
in the Single-Molecule Biophysics group (Weiss Lab), Department of Chemistry and 
Biochemistry at UCLA, in part in collaboration with the Intes Lab, Biomedical 
Engineering Department, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY and the 
Barroso Lab, Department of Molecular and Cellular Physiology, Albany Medical 
School, Albany, NY. It owes much to the feedback and suggestions of its users, 
which I hereby thank for their trust, courage and patience. 

The software code includes open source code from many third party developers 
listed in the licenses.txt file found in the installation folder.

This work was funded in part by DOE grant DE-FC02-02ER63421-00 and DE-SC0020338, 
Human Frontier Science Program grant RGP0061/2015, US National Institutes of 
Health grants R01 GM095904 and R01 CA250636, University of California CRCC
