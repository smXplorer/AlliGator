How to report an issue
----------------------

When reporting a problem, it helps if you can provide as much details as 
possible. In particular, try to reproduce the problem after having checked off 
*Verbose Error Mode* in the **Settings:Miscellaneous** panel. If the problem is 
due to some bug, or failure to perform a specific task (by contrast to 
providing "unexpected" results), this should then result in an error message 
displayed in red in the Notebook. Please provide this error message along with 
your description of the problem. If you are able to share your file(s) and 
Notebook, this might also help with diagnosing the issue.

While it is sometimes difficult as a user to figure out whether a problem is 
due to a bug or data-specific, it will be helpful to everyone if issues can be 
classified as "cosmetic-issue", "question" or "bug-report" by posting in one of 
the corresponding categories. To associate a post with one or more categories, 
open the post and look for the following icon at the top of the page:

Select the desired categorie(s) and click ``Apply`` at the bottom of the list.

Feature suggestions are welcome (although no warranty of any kind is made that 
they will be implemented) and should be categorized as such 
("feature-suggestion") by selecting the appropriate label as explained above.

Other questions or comments belong to the "other-posts" category.
