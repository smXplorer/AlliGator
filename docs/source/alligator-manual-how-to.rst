How to use this manual
======================

The manual is work in progress and is intended to replace the legacy manual hosted
on Google Sites at `https://web.archive.org/web/20201028034436/https://sites.google.com/a/g.ucla.edu/alligator/manual <https://web.archive.org/web/20201028034436/https://sites.google.com/a/g.ucla.edu/alligator/manual>`_.
Missing information in this manual can in general be found in that legacy manual.

The manual is (generally) updated as new versions of the software are released. 
The version  you are looking at is indicated in the small 
``v: X.XX`` drop-down  menu on the bottom right of the Table of Content column 
in the online manual.

Change this to the version you want to learn about, if that is not the latest 
version.

It is also possible to download a PDF version of the manual by selecting ``PDF``
in the aforementioned drop-down menu.

You can click on links embedded in the manual's pages to jump directly to a 
topic of interest, or select a topic in the Table of Content.

Access the Table of Content by clicking on the  Table of Contents link on the 
left or on the AlliGator x.xx.x documentation link at the top.

Alternatively, you can simply follow the page hierarchy by clicking on the 
``Previous`` or ``Next`` buttons at the bottom of  each page.

It is of course also possible to use the ``Go back`` or ``Go forward`` buttons 
of the browser to step through the browsing history.

Notations
---------

Throughout this manual, individual objects (`controls`, which the user can 
interact with, or `indicators`, which only display information to the user) 
will be referred to by their name (which shows up in the **Context Help** 
window when opened) highlighted in *italics*.

Windows or panels will be indicated by their title indicated in **bold**. 
For windows with subpanels, the notation **Window:Subpanel** will be used.

Values which a control or indicator can take will be indicated with 
``this style``.

Menus and menu items will be rendered as follows: ``menu item`` or 
``menu:submenu:menu item``.

Links to different sections or pages of the manual will appear underlined when 
moving the mouse over them, like the link to
