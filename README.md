# AlliGator
LabVIEW software for FLI dataset analysis

The LabVIEW 2021 SP1 source code can be found in the src directory. AlliGator 
depends on the following packages:

in vi.lib: 
- Vision Development Module
- IlluminatedG/AutoComplete
- JDP Science/Common Utilities, JSONText

in vi.lib/addons:
- Advanced Signal Processing Toolkit/Time Series Analysis, Time Frequency 
Analysis, Wavelet Analysis
- h5labview2

in user.lib:
- OpenG Toolkit/array, error, file, lvdata, string, variantconfig
- Hooovahh/Array VIMs

A list of Virtual Instruments (VIs) included in it, as well as their brief 
description by library can be found in the src-docs directory, in the 
Project-Documentation.html or the Project-Documentation.pdf file.

For the latest standalone AlliGator software installer, check the 
installer/latest folder. This executable requires the LabVIEW 2021 SP1 runtime 
(free) and Vision Development Module 2021 runtime (to be purchased from 
National Instruments/Emerson).

The latest manual can be found at https://alligator-distribution.readthedocs.io, 
where a PDF version can also be found.
