AlliGator Version History
=========================

Note: version numbers followed by an asterisk have not been released.

0.98.1 (2024-12-16)

    Bug Fix
        Removed parallelism in actions requiring ROI decay calculation due to some Vision Development Module memory read issue.

    New Feature
        Made Load Reference(s) window modal (so as to not to miss it when it is opened)

0.98 (2024-12-11)

    Bug Fixes
        Fixed bug in palette name decoding
        Fixed erroneous header of ASCII file created when exporting Decay Fit Parameter Map parameters

    CRITICAL BUG FIX
        fixed in AlliGator File Loading which would mix up max and sum images when building them one gate image at a time. This bug would affect any function using the Max or Sum image(s) for any processing. In particular, it would affect the displayed "Sum of All Gates" and "Max" images. It would also affect the following operations:
        pixel rejection based on pixel intensity (all analysis functions are affected)
        intensity-weighted maps
        fit parameter vs intensity plot(s)/phase lifetime vs intensity plot(s), etc.
        gate arithmetic
        Image Profile Window display
        Find optimal ROI
        ROI creation based on intensity above threshold
        In order to allow assessing the effect of this bug on analysis, a "toggle switch" has been added in the form of a "DEBUG" menu item in the "Help" menu. Selecting this menu item will toggle the critical bug from active to inactive. To allow this to take effect, reload the current dataset.
