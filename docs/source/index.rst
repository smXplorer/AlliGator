How to use this manual
----------------------

The manual is updated as new versions of the software are released. The version you are looking at is indicated in the small ``v: X.XX`` drop-down menu on the bottom right of the Table of Content column.

Change this to the version you want to learn about, if that is not the latest version.

It is also possible to download a PDF version of the manual by selecting ``PDF`` in the aforementioned drop-down menu.

You can click on links embedded in the manual's pages to jump directly to a topic of interest, select a topic in the Table of Content on the left, or simply follow the page hierarchy by clicking on the ``Previous`` or ``Next`` buttons at the bottom of each page.

Cliking on the ``Home`` button at the top of the Table of Content will bring you back to this page.
