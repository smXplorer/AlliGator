How to report an issue
----------------------

When reporting a problem, it helps if you can provide as much details as possible.
In particular, try to reproduce the problem after having turned on "Verbose Error 
Mode" in the **Settings:>Miscellaneous** panel. If the problem is due to some bug, 
or failure to perform a specific task (by contrast to providing "unexpected" 
results), this should result in an error message displayed in red in the 
Notebook (``Windows:Notebook``). Please provide this error message along with 
your description. If you are able to share your file(s) and Notebook, this might 
also help with diagnosing the issue.

While it is sometimes difficult as a user to figure out whether a problem is due 
to a bug or data-specific, it will be helpful to everyone if issues can be 
classified as "cosmetic", "question" or "bug" by posting in one of the 
corresponding categories.

Feature suggestions are welcome (although no warranty of any kind is made that 
they will be implemented) and should be categorized as such ("feature suggestion").
Other questions or comments belong to the "other posts" category.
