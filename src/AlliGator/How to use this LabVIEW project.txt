This project contains all the VIs needed to run AlliGator.
The VIs are organized into virtual folders and labVIEW libraries (*.lvlib) 
within these folders.
The AlliGator VIs Coolection.vi found at the bottom of the project contains all 
VIs used in AlliGator, including those that are dynamically loaded (i.e., which 
are not linked to in other VIs). It is recommended to open it at the beginning 
of a session for two reasons:
- when running AlliGator (see below), it speeds up the startup, as all VIs are 
already loaded in memory.
- when editing the code, it ensures that any modification to a VI or a control 
(in particular typedef controls) is propagated to all VIs and controls, 
avoiding linking conflicts which could otherwise occur.

To run AlliGator, first disclose the VIs virtual folder and then the 
AlliGator GUI.lvlib library. Finally, open up and run the AlliGator Launcher.vi 
at the top of the library (NOT the AlliGator.vi at the bottom of the library!).
